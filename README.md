# About the Documentation

The documentation can be found [here](https://teampopplio.github.io/PokemonUnityRedux/).

Pokémon Unity Redux is a work-in-progress rework of the original [Pokémon Unity](https://github.com/PokemonUnity/PokemonUnity/tree/master) in a modular formfactor. It is currently unfinished.

The pages written so far are due to change, any contribution made would be appreciated in the long term!
