</p>

Pokémon Unity Redux is to be a rewrite of the original Pokémon Unity in a modular formfactor.
This would make expansion and development easier as single-use scripts would be seperate from larger scripts.
The plan is to make modules depend on C#'s derivative system, using namespaces, classes, and subclasses would organize things better alongside introducing a "don't repeat yourself" motive.

This project is built around Pokémon Unity's legacy code and is currently unfinished.
